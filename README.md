# Steganography_data_hiding
Here, I have made a very easy to use steganography tool. 
It allows for parties to communicate(bi-directionally) openly/publicly in "plain sight" but would only appear as 
the transferring of digital photos at first glance. But, "hidden data" is actually embedded within the images. 
This tool allows for both extracting data from digital images as well as embedding data within digital images. 
Therefore, this tool could be used for cryptographic communications in a "public" setting while only appearing to 
be sending/receiving photos. 

In general, steganography can be described as "the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, 
file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. The use of steganography 
can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data".

This tool should be used locally and is equiped with full GUI capability. The tool can be operated by simply running the "RUN_ME" file.
